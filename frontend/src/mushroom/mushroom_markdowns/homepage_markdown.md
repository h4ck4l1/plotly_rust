 ## Observations and Experiments carried:

➼ Fitting tests were done on all the independent variables of each dataset.

➼ Top 10 Best Fits were plotted with interactive graphs.

➼ Inferences were drawn on each variable and the strength of the fit and fit was weighed for further explanations.

➼ Machine Learning was implemented for relevant datasets.

➼ Classifications and Regression Observations were carried out for 
 - Mushroomn Classification
 - Time Series analysis for kfc-stock
 - Covid-19 effects on different states on India

➼ Different ML algorithms were used ranging from simple Linear Regression to complex Gradient Boosting bagging algorithms and Neural Nets.

➼ For every dataset an index page has been provided for feature descrptions, experimentation methods, data collection strategies, cleaning processes etc.,
