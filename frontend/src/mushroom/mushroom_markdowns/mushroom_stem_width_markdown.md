- Mushroom Stem Width is a continuous column with measurements ranging from 0 to 3569. The 50th percentile (median) stem width is 923, and the mean stem width is 1051. These values suggest that the units of measurement are likely in tenths of millimeters, making the median stem width 92.3 millimeters (9.23 centimeters) and the mean 105.1 millimeters (10.51 centimeters).
    
- Fitting of all common distribution tests have been carried out. Among the distributions tested, stem width didn't ascribe to any specific distributions.

- The stem width of mushrooms can vary significantly across different species. For instance, the common mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) typically has a stem width of about 1-2 cm. In contrast, the Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria) often has a stem width of 1-2.5 cm. Larger species, such as the King Bolete (Boletus edulis), can have stems that reach widths of up to 5 cm or more.

- These variations highlight the diversity in stem widths among mushroom species, which can be influenced by environmental factors and genetic variations.
