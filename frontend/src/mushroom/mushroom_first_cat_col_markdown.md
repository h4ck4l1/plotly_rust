- Mushroom Cap diameter is a continuous column with measurements ranging from 0 to 1891.The 50th percentile (median) cap diameter is 525, and the mean cap diameter is 567. These values suggest that the units of measurement are likely in tenths of millimeters, making the median cap diameter 52.5 millimeters (5.25 centimeters) and the mean 56.7 millimeters (5.67 centimeters).

- Fitting of all common distribution tests have been carried out. Among the distributions tested, cap diameter didn't ascribe to any specific distributions but relative probabilities suggest a close relative of a variation of nakagami.

- The cap diameter of mushrooms can vary significantly across different species. For instance, the common mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) typically has a cap diameter of 5-10 cm, while the Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria) can range from 8-20 cm. On the larger end of the spectrum, the Giant Puffball (Calvatia gigantea) can exceed 50 cm in diameter.

- These variations highlight the diversity in cap sizes among mushroom species, which can be influenced by environmental factors and genetic variations.
