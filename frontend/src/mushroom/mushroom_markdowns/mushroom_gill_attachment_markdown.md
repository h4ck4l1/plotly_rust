- Mushroom Gill Attachment is a categorical column that describes the way gills are attached to the stem. Common types of gill attachment include free, attached, and decurrent. The distribution of gill attachment types is crucial for mushroom identification.

- Fitting all common categorical distribution tests has been carried out for this column. Among the distributions tested, Gill Attachment did not conform to any known distributions. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that any distribution fits the gill attachment data at significance levels Î±: 0.1, 0.05, 0.001.

- The gill attachment types range from 0 to 6, with a median value of 1.
