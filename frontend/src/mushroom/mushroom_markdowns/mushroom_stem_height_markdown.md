- Mushroom Stem Height is a continuous column with measurements ranging from 0.000426 to 3.83532. The mean stem height is 0.75911, and the median stem height is 0.5632. These values suggest that the units of measurement could be in centimeters, with the median stem height being approximately 0.5632 centimeters (5.632 millimeters) and the mean height being 0.75911 centimeters (7.5911 millimeters).

- In the real world, mushroom stem heights can vary significantly across different species. For example:

    - **Common Mushroom (Agaricus bisporus)**: Typically has a stem height ranging from 3 to 10 centimeters.
    - **Fly Agaric (Amanita muscaria)**: Known for its iconic red cap, can have a stem height ranging from 5 to 20 centimeters.
    - **Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)**: Typically has a stem height of about 5 to 15 centimeters.
    - **Oyster Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)**: Generally has a stem height between 2 to 6 centimeters.

- These variations highlight the diversity in stem heights among different mushroom species, which can be influenced by environmental factors, genetic variations, and growth conditions.

- Extensive tests on common continuous distributions have been performed. The analysis shows that Stem Height does not conform to any specific distribution, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis for all significance levels Î±: 0.1, 0.05, 0.001.
